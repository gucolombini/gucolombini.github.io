                <p>My name is Gustavo Colombini, I am a Computer Engineering student on my second year at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.inteli.edu.br/en/">Institute of Technology and Leadership (Inteli)</a>. I'm an aspiring Game Developer and Designer, passionate about every single step that it takes to bring a game to life, both on the programming and artistic departments.</p>
                <p>I have since gained continuous experience in many programming languages, such as <span class="label c">C</span>, <span class="label c">C#</span>, <span class="label javascript">JavaScript</span>, or whatever I need to learn to do what I want to do! All the while I've been honing my skills on <span class="label gamedesign">Game Design</span>, <span class="label art">2D Art</span> and <span class="label art">Animation</span>, and even composing a bit of <span class="label music">Music</span>!</p>
                <p>I've built several projects over the last few years, and I've always felt like I didn't have a good place to display and share them all, so this is why I created this website.</p>
                <p>Hope you enjoy it!</p>

                <p>Lightly Hungry (2024) is a 2D platformer mixed with stealth-like elements, developed for the <a target="_blank" href="https://itch.io/jam/ctrl-alt-jam-3">CTRL ALT JAM 3</a> competition. You play as Tenebris, and your goal is to shroud the whole kingdom in darkness, and what's a better way to do that than eating all the light sources you see? Just be sneaky about it, you don't want to get caught!</p>
                <p>For this project I worked closely with every facet of development, including game design, art direction and programming. I was responsible for animating all the characters and importing most of the assets in the game, taking the level design concepts and building them in the engine, several bug fixes, plus most of the sound design, including the soundtrack for the cutscenes and cave levels.</p>
                <p>Making this game was a huge undertaking considering the short development window, being only 2 weeks (plus 2 more after we were selected for the second phase of the competition), so my team management skills were essential to keep us all on track. I learned a lot about how to properly define realisitic goals and scope for a game, and am really proud of all that was accomplished in such a tight timeframe!</p>

                <p>Kaos com K (2024) is a highscore-based game where you must cause the most chaos and destruction within the school premises, all the while avoiding your teacher who's trying to stop your antics. Will you rebel against the system and be able to escape?</p>
                <p>As the sole artist for the team, I designed and animated all of the assets. I landed on a pixel-art aesthetic so I could balance efficiency and style, complementing the arcade-like nature of the game.</p>
                <p>The track that plays throughout gameplay was composed by me; It's punk rock that uses a ton of percussion, an aggressive beat and heavily distorted vocals + electric guitar to fit with the energetic and rebellious nature of the game. Making this song was a blast, especially the vocals! (They are basically gibberish and that's really funny to me)</p>
                <p>Beyond art and music, I also helped polish gameplay by tweaking and fixing several mechanics to ensure a smooth experience. This included refining player and enemy movement, correcting an inconsistent slingshot projectile curve, and resolving a few softlocks that appeared during testing.</p>

                <p>Marygold (2025) is a bait-and-switch horror browser game developed by me and my girlfriend as one of her University projects. You play as a cute little bunny and must collect the carrots in your farm, but the innocent fa√ßade quickly fades when a wolf approaches.</p>
                <p>While I didn't work on the art or game design, I was fully responsible for the programming and music. The game was envisioned as a lost children's game you'd find in the 2000-2010s, so I worked really hard to fit that vision and make it feel as authentic as possible.</p>
                <p>I scripted a custom level loading system which let me build the levels using Tiled and allowed me to easily create stages for the game. I was also able to implement a few shaders to allow for some glitchy and distorted visual effects in-game. Translating concept art and rough design documents into a polished, interactive experience was a great exercise!</p>

                <p>Crashado (2025) is a point and click survival game where you must keep your computer from crashing by closing pop-ups, rebooting your router, reconnecting cables, and even playing music?</p>
                <p>This project was a 3-day endeavor created for the first Inteli GameJam, an internal game jam in our college which I helped organize and promote, and also joined as a participant. I participated in the game design stage so we could come up with all the mechanics for the game. I drew all of the assets for the game (except for the gameplay, that's just a recording), it was especially fun to make the pop-ups and shove as many jokes as I could in them!</p>
                <p>After we were done implementing all functionality in the game, I spent a long time tweaking the gameplay loop, fixing bugs and just overall polishing everything up. I also helped the sound designer to implement all audio in the game, as I already had prior experience with sound in Unity from the other games.</p>

                <p>GameLab Inc. (2025) is an idle clicker mobile game where you must code and release video games to grow and upgrade your studio. You can buy consumables such as energy drinks to get a boost in your coding speed, but be careful as the power can go out randomly and slow you down!</p>
                <p>This project is a submission to an internal 3-day Hackaton at Wildlife Studios, which I had the privilege to participate in and develop the game in their office and making use of their proprietary technologies. This was an incredible learning experience for me, and I was able to quickly adapt to their custom workflow.</p>
                <p>I had a hand in conceptualizing the game, specifically on how the main mechanics and progression worked. I was also responsible for the game's art direction and assets, which I decided on a flat neon artstyle so I could make assets quickly while also giving the game an appealing and marketable art style. I coded in the visual effects for the code snippets coming out of the screen, and also the entire light's out random event mechanic.</p>
                <p>The game was submitted and accepted on the Google Play Store, where you can download and play the game right now! Right now the game is at an unfinished state, as we cut out a lot of other ideas due to time constraints, but it taught me a lot about mobile development and I am really proud with all we managed to do with it.</p>

                <p>I am making all of the assets myself, based on the artwork seen on Super Mario promotional media. I currently want to deliver a fully playable level, with a small assortment of enemies and even power-ups.</p>
